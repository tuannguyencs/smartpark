The application will use a couple different sensors to tell whether a car is in a parking spot or not, then those sensors will communicate the data through a LoRa gateway and then to the backend and frontend of the application. The application will then show the user whether the spot is taken or not based on the color code, and people will be able to find open parking that way.")
